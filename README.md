Practice stuff w/ leaflet.js.

I started a leaflet tutorial I found from a MaptimeSF Tumblr post, but the content had not been updated and wasn't
functional with the currently supported leaflet library versions.  Luckily I was able to have someone who knew their 
stuff near me on my second attempt to I could ask questions. Index is functioning version of a GISC (GIS Collective) 
tutorial: http://giscollective.org/tutorials/web-mapping/leaflet-1/#comment-4660 which very possibly works if you find the
really old version the tutorial calls for. Index right now in this repo has a somewhat functioning result of the tutorial 
using the current leaflet library (as of 8/5/2013). 

### Currently working through leaflet.js tutorials right off their site


Some really solid leaflet.js tutorials are available right on their site: <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples.html">leaflet 
tutorials.</a>

Now gotta get my lazy butt doing some of those...
